# Restaurant Reviews

> Student Project #3 during Advanced Front-End Development Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

For the Restaurant Reviews project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. First, I take a static design that lacks **accessibility** and convert the design to be **responsive** on different sized displays and accessible for **screen reader use**. I also add a service worker to create a seamless **offline experience** for the users.

For the project instructions and initial code on how I got started, check this [branch](./../../tree/initial-code). 

## Instructions

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
